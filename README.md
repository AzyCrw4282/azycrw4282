- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning(advancing on) Go, Python, Docker, VueJS
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration on enhancing some of my existing projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: My name is pronouced just like [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
- ðŸ“§ `print("".join(chr(i) for i in [97, 122, 107, 121, 109, 117, 98, 97, 114, 97, 99, 107, 49, 50, 51, 64, 103, 109, 97, 105, 108, 46, 99, 111, 109]))`
